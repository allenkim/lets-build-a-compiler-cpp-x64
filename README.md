# Let's Build a Compiler - C++ Version with x86-64 Assembly

["Let's Build a Compiler"](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/) is an awesome series by Jack Crenshaw to introduce beginners to compilers, but the code for the compiler is written in Turbo Pascal and outputs assembly in 68000 code. This will try to convert the Turbo Pascal code into C++ equivalent, and the assembly into x86-64 equivalent.
